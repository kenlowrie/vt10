<!--
    This is a fully self-contained page that is generated at build time by Gulp.
    
    Here we include the standard header and footer, and override the title, sections and classes as needed.
    
    This is only useful for a static page, like the home page of a website, or something that won't be
    generated on the fly by PHP.
    
    This file is included via PHP, in this case it's the index.php file.

            <h3>Video Trainer</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the <em>Video Training System</em>! This app allows you to <em>organize</em> a series of videos in a way that makes them easy to <em>navigate</em>, and looks much better than a page full of links. Or at least I think it does.</p>
            <p>To get started, click on the menu above and select <a href="videos.php">Videos</a>, or just click on it instead.</p>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>Someday, when I've got nothing better to do, I'll write some documentation for the system. Or maybe not. Yeah, probably not. Instead, I'll write self-documenting code. That's it! Okay... Done! Check!</p>
